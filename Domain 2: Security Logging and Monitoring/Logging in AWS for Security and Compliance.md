# Logging in AWS for Security and Compliance

**To help compliance requirements,AWS provides many service-specific security and audit logs**

**Service Logs include:**

 CloudTrail trails - trace all API calls
 
Config Rules - for config & compliance over time

CloudWatch Logs - for full data retention

 VPC Flow Logs - IP traffic within your VPC
 
 ELB Access Logs - metadata of requests made to your load balancers
 
 CloudFront Logs - web distribution access logs
 
 WAF Logs - full logging of all requests analyzed by the service

**Logs can be analyzed using AWS Athena if theyâ€™re stored in S3**

**You should encrypt logs in S3, control access using IAM & Bucket Policies, MFA**

**Move Logs to Glacier for cost savings**
