# Amazon Detective

- GuardDuty, Macie, and Security Hub are used to identify potential security issues, or findings
- Sometimes security findings require deeper analysis to isolate the root cause and take action – it’s a complex process
- Amazon Detective analyzes, investigates, and quickly identifies the root cause of security issues or suspicious activities using ML and graphs
- Automatically collects and processes events from VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty to create a unified view
- Produces visualizations with details and context to get to the root cause
